# course_registration

DESCRIPTION:

A quick python program that I made, which uses automated keyboard events to speed up class registration.






HOW TO USE:

index.html is setup like the actual registration website so that the user can practice. This ensures that there is no confusion when registration actually occurs.

1. Build register.py and enter your CRN numbers.
2. Make sure that the registration window is open in the background (such that if you press cmd + tab, it should open)
3. Press "Submit" and quickly click on the first field.
4. Your CRN numbers should be filled out shortlyâ€“now just click submit
