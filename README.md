# course_registration

**DESCRIPTION:**
A quick python program that uses automated keyboard events to speed up class registration.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
To install dependencies, run the following in terminal: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**HOW TO USE:**
index.html is setup like the actual registration website so that the user can practice. This ensures that there is no confusion when registration actually occurs.

1. Build register.py `python ui.py`, and a widget should open.
2. Enter your CRN numbers. 
3. Make sure that the registration window (Add_Drop_Classes_.html) is open in the background (such that if you press cmd + tab, it should open)
4. Press "Submit" and the widget will disappear and open the window in the background (which should be Add_Drop_Classes_.html). You will have half a second to click on the first field. If this is not long enough for you, it can be adjusted in ui.py.
5. Your CRN numbers should be filled out shortlyâ€“now just click submit
